Best practices:

HA Multi-Node: Multiple master and workers
EKS or Kops, GKE, AKS, kubeadm/kubespray Setup and other
Up to 5K nodes in cluster
Up to 150K PODs in cluster
up to 300K Containers in cluster
Up to 100 PODs per Node

Platform:
 Master always on Linux
 Win container escape vulnerabilities
 Instance Limitations in Clouds with Windows

Placement:
    Compliance
    Kubeadm/spray On-premise
    EKS, GKE, AKS, ACK etc

Masters can host workload, but in best practice is to not hosts workloads

HA for ETCD:
    ETCD leader election:
        RAFT proto for elect another leader
        Quorum = N/2+1 (Number of instances that have to participate in the elections process)
    Best to choose an odd number of instances

Steps for setup cluster:
1) Install container runtime environment (docker etc)
2) Install kubeadm
3) Init master server
4) Install POD Network
5) Join other nodes to cluster

kubeadm cmd:

sudo kubeadm init \
    --control-plane-endpoint=<LOADBALANCER_IP_ADDR> \
    --upload-certs \
    --apiserver-advertise-address=<IP_ADDR> \
    --pod-network-cidr=<CIDR_BLOCK> #Depends of net pluggin 10.224.0.0 for WeaveNet
